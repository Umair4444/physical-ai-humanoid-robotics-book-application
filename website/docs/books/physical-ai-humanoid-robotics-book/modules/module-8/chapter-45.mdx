## Lesson: Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control and Behavior

### Introduction to Reinforcement Learning in Robotics

Reinforcement Learning (RL) in robotics represents a paradigm where robots learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment, guided by reward signals that indicate successful task completion.
