## Lesson: Cognitive Architectures for Humanoid Robots

### Introduction to Cognitive Architectures

Cognitive architectures in humanoid robots are comprehensive frameworks that organize the various components needed for intelligent behavior. Unlike simple reactive systems, cognitive architectures enable robots to plan, reason, learn, and adapt to new situations while maintaining coherent behavior over time.

A cognitive architecture typically includes:
- **Perception systems**: For understanding the environment and internal state
- **Memory systems**: For storing and retrieving information
- **Reasoning systems**: For making decisions and drawing inferences
- **Learning mechanisms**: For adapting behavior based on experience
- **Action selection**: For choosing appropriate behaviors
- **Motivation systems**: For determining goals and priorities

The goal is to create a unified system that can exhibit flexible, adaptive, and intelligent behavior in complex environments.

### Historical Foundations

**Early Cognitive Architectures**: 
- **ACT-R** (Adaptive Control of Thought - Rational): Emphasizes the role of memory and learning in cognition
- **SOAR**: Based on problem-solving and learning through operators
- **LISP**: Early symbolic approach to AI and cognitive modeling

**Embodied Cognition**: The idea that cognition is shaped by the body and environment
- Challenges traditional view of cognition as purely brain-based
- Emphasizes the importance of sensorimotor interaction
- Influences the design of embodied AI systems

**Subsumption Architecture**: Developed by Rodney Brooks
- Decentralized control with multiple layers of behavior
- No central representation or planning
- Demonstrates complex behavior from simple interacting components

### Components of Cognitive Architectures

**Memory Systems**:
- **Sensory Memory**: Brief storage of sensory information
- **Working Memory**: Active workspace for current processing
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage of knowledge and experiences
  - Declarative memory: Facts and events
  - Procedural memory: Skills and processes
  - Episodic memory: Personal experiences
- **Memory Consolidation**: Processes for transferring information between memory types

**Attention Mechanisms**:
- **Selective Attention**: Focusing on relevant information
- **Divided Attention**: Processing multiple information streams
- **Sustained Attention**: Maintaining focus over time
- **Executive Attention**: Controlling attention allocation

**Reasoning Systems**:
- **Deductive Reasoning**: Drawing specific conclusions from general principles
- **Inductive Reasoning**: Forming general principles from specific observations
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Making the best explanation from incomplete information
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Applying knowledge from one domain to another

### Types of Cognitive Architectures

**Symbolic Architectures**:
- Use explicit symbols and rules to represent knowledge
- Emphasize logical reasoning and problem-solving
- Examples: ACT-R, SOAR, CLIPS
- Advantages: Interpretable, verifiable reasoning
- Disadvantages: Difficulty with uncertainty and learning

**Connectionist Architectures**:
- Use neural networks to represent knowledge implicitly
- Emphasize learning and pattern recognition
- Examples: Deep neural networks, neural-symbolic systems
- Advantages: Learning capability, robustness to noise
- Disadvantages: Lack of interpretability, difficulty with symbolic reasoning

**Hybrid Architectures**:
- Combine symbolic and connectionist approaches
- Attempt to gain advantages of both
- Examples: Neural-Symbolic systems, Logic Tensor Networks
- Approaches: Embedding symbols in neural networks, using neural networks to guide symbolic reasoning

**Behavior-Based Architectures**:
- Organize cognition around behaviors rather than representations
- Hierarchical or distributed organization of behaviors
- Examples: Subsumption architecture, Behavior networks
- Advantages: Real-time response, robustness
- Disadvantages: Difficulty with complex reasoning
