## Lesson: Perception Systems for Physical AI

### Introduction to Perception in Physical AI

Perception systems in Physical AI enable robots to understand and interpret their environment and internal state. Unlike traditional AI that processes digital information, Physical AI systems must extract meaningful information from real-world sensory data, which is often noisy, incomplete, and ambiguous.

The perception system serves as the robot's "senses," including:
- Vision systems for recognizing objects, people, and environments
- Auditory systems for understanding speech and environmental sounds
- Tactile systems for sensing touch, pressure, and texture
- Proprioceptive systems for understanding body position and movement
- Vestibular systems for balance and orientation

These systems must work together to create a coherent understanding of the world and the robot's position within it.
