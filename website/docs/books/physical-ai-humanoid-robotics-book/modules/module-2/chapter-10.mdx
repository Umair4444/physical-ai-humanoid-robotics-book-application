## Lesson: Humanoid Locomotion and Balance Control

### Introduction to Humanoid Locomotion

Humanoid locomotion represents one of the most complex challenges in robotics, requiring the robot to achieve dynamic stability while moving through complex environments. Unlike wheeled robots that rely on continuous ground contact, humanoid robots must manage the inherent instability of bipedal walking, where the center of mass must be carefully controlled with respect to the support base.

The key challenges in humanoid locomotion include:
- **Dynamic Balance**: Maintaining stability during the single-support and double-support phases of walking
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Navigating uneven surfaces, stairs, and obstacles
- **Energy Efficiency**: Achieving human-like efficiency in locomotion
- **Robustness**: Recovering from disturbances and unexpected events
- **Real-time Control**: Processing sensor information and generating responses within tight time constraints

### Biomechanics of Human Walking

**Gait Cycle Analysis**:
- The gait cycle consists of stance phase (60%) and swing phase (40%)
- Single support phase: only one foot on the ground
- Double support phase: both feet on the ground
- Heel strike, loading response, mid-stance, terminal stance, pre-swing, initial swing, mid-swing, and terminal swing sub-phases
- Understanding natural human gait to inform robot control strategies

**Center of Mass (CoM) Dynamics**:
- Human CoM moves in a sinusoidal pattern vertically
