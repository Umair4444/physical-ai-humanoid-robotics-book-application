## Lesson: Adaptive Control and Online Learning in Physical AI

### Introduction to Adaptive Control

Adaptive control in Physical AI refers to control systems that can modify their behavior in response to changes in the environment, the robot's physical state, or task requirements. This capability is essential for robots operating in dynamic, uncertain, and changing environments where fixed controllers would fail to maintain performance.

Online learning is a subset of adaptive control that focuses on learning and improving performance during operation, as opposed to offline learning that occurs during dedicated training phases. This real-time adaptation is critical for robots that must maintain function while learning new skills or adapting to changes.
