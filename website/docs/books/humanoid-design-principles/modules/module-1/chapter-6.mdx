## Lesson: Designing for Human-Robot Interaction and Social Integration

### Introduction to Social Integration in Humanoid Design

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in human environments and interact with humans, making social integration a critical aspect of their design. Unlike specialized industrial robots, humanoids must be accepted and trusted by humans, requiring careful consideration of social cues, communication modalities, and interaction patterns. This chapter explores the principles and techniques for designing humanoid robots that can effectively integrate into human social environments.

### Social Cues and Communication in Humanoid Design
