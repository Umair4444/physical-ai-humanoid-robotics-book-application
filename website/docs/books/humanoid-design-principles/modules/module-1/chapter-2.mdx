## Lesson: Biomechanics and Human Movement Analysis

### Introduction to Biomechanics in Humanoid Design

Biomechanics is the study of the structure, function, and motion of the mechanical elements of biological systems. In humanoid design, biomechanics provides the foundation for understanding human movement patterns, joint configurations, and mechanical principles that can be applied to create robots that move and function like humans. Understanding human biomechanics is crucial for developing humanoid robots that can interact effectively with human environments and perform tasks that require human-like capabilities.
