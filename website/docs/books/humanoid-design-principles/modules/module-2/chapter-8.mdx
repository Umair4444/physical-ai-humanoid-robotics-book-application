## Lesson: Kinematic Analysis of Humanoid Robots

### Introduction to Kinematics

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. In humanoid robotics, kinematic analysis is essential for understanding how the robot's joints and links move to achieve desired positions and orientations. This analysis forms the foundation for motion planning, control, and design of humanoid robots.

Kinematic concepts in humanoid robotics include:
- **Forward kinematics**: Determining end-effector position from joint angles
- **Inverse kinematics**: Determining joint angles from desired end-effector position
- **Degrees of freedom**: The number of independent movements possible
- **Workspace analysis**: The range of positions and orientations achievable

### Forward Kinematics

#### Definition and Purpose
Forward kinematics calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector (typically the hand or foot) based on known joint angles. This is essential for predicting where the robot will place its limbs given specific joint configurations.

**Mathematical representation**: Forward kinematics uses transformation matrices to describe the relationship between different coordinate frames attached to robot links.

**Coordinate systems**: Each link in the robot has an associated coordinate frame:
- **Base frame**: Fixed to the robot's base or torso
- **Joint frames**: Aligned with joint axes
- **End-effector frame**: Attached to the tool or interaction point

#### Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Convention
The DH convention provides a systematic method for defining coordinate frames on robot links:

**DH parameters**:
- **Link length (a)**: Distance along the common normal between joint axes
- **Link twist (α)**: Angle between joint axes about the common normal
- **Link offset (d)**: Distance along the previous joint axis to the common normal
- **Joint angle (θ)**: Angle about the current joint axis from the previous x-axis

**Transformation matrices**: Each joint-link pair is represented by a 4x4 transformation matrix that combines rotation and translation.

**Application to humanoid robots**: The DH convention must be adapted for the complex kinematic chains in humanoid robots, including the closed-loop chains formed by the torso and limbs.

#### Kinematic Chains in Humanoid Robots

**Serial chains**: Most humanoid limbs follow serial kinematic chains:
- **Human arm equivalent**: Shoulder (3 DOF) → Elbow (1 DOF) → Wrist (2 DOF)
- **Human leg equivalent**: Hip (3 DOF) → Knee (1 DOF) → Ankle (2 DOF)
- **Head/neck**: Multiple DOF for looking and nodding

**Tree structures**: Humanoid robots have branched kinematic structures:
- **Torso as central trunk**: All limbs branch from the torso
- **Multiple end-effectors**: Hands and feet as interaction points
- **Redundant paths**: Multiple ways to achieve the same configuration

### Inverse Kinematics

#### Definition and Purpose
Inverse kinematics solves for the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation. This is crucial for task execution, where the robot must reach specific targets.

**Mathematical complexity**: Inverse kinematics often involves solving systems of nonlinear equations, which can have multiple solutions or no solutions.

**Multiple solutions**: Redundant robots (with more DOF than required) have infinite solutions for reaching a given pose.

#### Analytical Solutions
For simple kinematic chains, closed-form solutions exist:

**Geometric approach**: Using geometric relationships to solve for joint angles.
**Algebraic approach**: Converting kinematic equations to polynomial form.
**Pieper's solution**: For 6 DOF chains with intersecting axes.

**Limitations**: Analytical solutions are only possible for specific kinematic structures.

#### Numerical Solutions
For complex humanoid robots, numerical methods are typically used:

**Jacobian-based methods**: Using the Jacobian matrix to relate joint velocities to end-effector velocities:
- **Pseudoinverse**: Computing joint velocities to achieve desired end-effector motion
- **Damped least squares**: Adding damping to handle singularities
- **Weighted pseudoinverse**: Prioritizing certain DOF over others

**Iterative methods**: Refining joint angles through repeated calculations:
- **Newton-Raphson**: Using derivatives to find solutions
- **Gradient descent**: Minimizing error between current and desired poses
- **Cyclic coordinate descent**: Adjusting one joint at a time

#### Challenges in Humanoid Inverse Kinematics

**Redundancy**: Humanoid robots typically have more DOF than needed for most tasks:
- **Optimization criteria**: Need to select the best solution from many possibilities
- **Joint limit avoidance**: Staying within physical joint limits
- **Obstacle avoidance**: Finding paths that avoid self-collision and environmental obstacles

**Singularities**: Configurations where the robot loses degrees of freedom:
- **Kinematic singularities**: Mathematical singularities in the Jacobian
- **Physical singularities**: Configurations where joints align
- **Avoidance strategies**: Planning paths around singular configurations

### Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Analysis

#### Counting DOF
The number of independent parameters needed to specify the configuration of a mechanical system:

**Grübler's formula**: For planar mechanisms: DOF = 3(n-1) - 2j - h, where n is number of links, j is number of joints, and h is higher pairs.

**Screw theory**: For spatial mechanisms, using six-dimensional screws to represent motion.

#### DOF in Humanoid Robots
Humanoid robots have multiple DOF distributed across the body:

**Human comparison**: Humans have approximately 230+ DOF in their skeletal system, though not all are independently controllable.

**Robot implementations**: Current humanoid robots typically have 20-60 DOF:
- **Honda ASIMO**: ~57 DOF
- **Boston Dynamics Atlas**: ~28 DOF
- **SoftBank NAO**: ~25 DOF

**Functional DOF**: The DOF that contribute to task performance:
- **Locomotion DOF**: DOF needed for walking and balance
- **Manipulation DOF**: DOF needed for object manipulation
- **Interaction DOF**: DOF needed for human-robot interaction

### Workspace Analysis

#### Definition
The workspace is the set of all possible positions and orientations that the end-effector can reach.

**Reachable workspace**: All positions the end-effector can reach regardless of orientation.
**Dexterous workspace**: All positions and orientations the end-effector can achieve.
**Orientation workspace**: All orientations achievable at a given position.

#### Workspace Visualization
Methods for representing and analyzing workspace:

**Discrete sampling**: Calculating reachable points through random sampling of joint angles.
**Analytical methods**: Mathematical description of workspace boundaries.
**Graphical representation**: 3D visualization of workspace volume.

#### Workspace Optimization
Design considerations for maximizing useful workspace:

**Joint limit optimization**: Setting joint limits to maximize useful workspace.
**Link length optimization**: Choosing link lengths to achieve desired workspace.
**Configuration optimization**: Positioning the robot to maximize workspace for tasks.

### Kinematic Constraints

Real-world limitations on robot motion:

**Joint limits**: Mechanical stops that limit joint angle ranges:
- **Safety**: Preventing damage to the robot
- **Biological accuracy**: Matching human joint ranges for humanoid appearance
- **Task requirements**: Optimizing for specific tasks

**Actuator limits**: Constraints on joint velocities and accelerations:
- **Speed limits**: Maximum angular velocities
- **Torque limits**: Maximum forces that can be applied
- **Power limits**: Maximum power consumption

#### Environmental Constraints
Constraints imposed by the environment:

**Obstacle avoidance**: Avoiding collisions with environmental objects:
- **Collision detection**: Identifying potential collisions
- **Path planning**: Finding collision-free paths
- **Dynamic obstacles**: Avoiding moving objects

**Self-collision avoidance**: Preventing robot links from colliding with each other:
- **Link-link collisions**: Preventing different robot parts from colliding
