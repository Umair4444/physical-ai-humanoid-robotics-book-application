## Lesson: Grasp Synthesis and Optimization

### Introduction to Grasp Synthesis

Grasp synthesis is the process of automatically generating effective grasp configurations for robotic hands to interact with objects. This involves determining where to place the fingertips or gripper contacts on an object's surface, how to configure the hand, and what forces to apply to achieve a stable and task-appropriate grasp. Grasp synthesis is a complex optimization problem that must consider geometric, physical, and task constraints simultaneously.

Grasp synthesis involves:
- **Contact placement**: Determining optimal contact locations on the object
- **Hand configuration**: Configuring the hand's joints and posture
- **Force distribution**: Distributing forces appropriately among contacts
- **Task adaptation**: Adapting grasps to specific manipulation tasks

### Mathematical Foundations of Grasp Synthesis

#### Grasp Representation
How grasps are mathematically represented:

**Contact-based representation**:
- **Contact points**: 3D positions where the gripper contacts the object
- **Contact normals**: Surface normals at contact points
- **Contact forces**: Forces applied at each contact point
- **Contact frames**: Local coordinate systems at each contact

**Configuration-based representation**:
- **Joint angles**: Angles of all joints in the robotic hand
- **Hand pose**: Position and orientation of the entire hand
- **Gripper parameters**: Specific parameters for parallel jaw grippers
- **Shape parameters**: Parameters describing hand configuration

#### Wrench Space and Grasp Analysis
Mathematical framework for analyzing grasp stability:

**Wrench definition**: A wrench is a 6-dimensional vector combining forces and torques: (f_x, f_y, f_z, τ_x, τ_y, τ_z).

**Grasp wrench space**: The space of all wrenches that a grasp can resist.

**Grasp matrix**: Relates contact forces to the wrench applied to the object:
- **G = [n₁, n₂, ..., nₖ]** where nᵢ represents the contact screw for contact i
- **Relationship**: Gf = w, where f is contact forces and w is object wrench

**Force closure condition**: A grasp has force closure if the origin is in the interior of the convex hull of the contact screws.

### Optimization Approaches
