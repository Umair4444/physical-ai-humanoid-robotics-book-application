## Lesson: Sensor-Based Grasp Planning and Feedback Control

### Introduction to Sensor-Based Grasping

Sensor-based grasp planning and feedback control represent a paradigm shift from purely model-based approaches to approaches that incorporate real-time sensory information during the grasping process.
