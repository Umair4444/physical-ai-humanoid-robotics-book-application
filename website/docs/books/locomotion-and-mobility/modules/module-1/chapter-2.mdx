## Lesson: Legged Locomotion and Bipedal Walking

### Introduction to Legged Locomotion

Legged locomotion is one of the most versatile forms of robotic mobility, enabling robots to navigate complex terrains that would be challenging or impossible for wheeled or tracked systems. Bipedal walking, in particular, is of special interest as it allows robots to move through human environments designed for human locomotion. This chapter explores the principles, challenges, and techniques involved in legged locomotion and bipedal walking.

### Principles of Legged Locomotion

#### Advantages of Legged Locomotion

**Terrain Adaptability**:
Legged robots can navigate terrains that would be challenging for other locomotion methods.

**Capabilities**:
- **Step Over Obstacles**: Ability to step over gaps and obstacles
- **Rough Terrain Navigation**: Movement over uneven surfaces
- **Stair Climbing**: Ascending and descending stairs
- **Variable Ground Conditions**: Adaptation to different surface types

**Applications**:
- **Search and Rescue**: Navigating disaster areas
- **Exploration**: Moving through natural environments
- **Human Environments**: Operating in spaces designed for humans
- **Maintenance**: Accessing hard-to-reach areas

#### Challenges of Legged Locomotion

**Control Complexity**:
Legged locomotion requires sophisticated control systems to maintain balance and coordinate movement.

**Key Challenges**:
- **Balance Maintenance**: Keeping the robot upright during movement
- **Dynamic Stability**: Managing stability during dynamic motion
- **Coordination**: Coordinating multiple legs and joints
- **Energy Efficiency**: Managing power consumption during locomotion

**Mechanical Complexity**:
Legged robots require multiple joints and actuators, increasing mechanical complexity.

**Issues**:
- **Increased Failure Points**: More components that can fail
- **Weight Considerations**: Additional actuators and structure
- **Maintenance Requirements**: More complex maintenance needs
- **Cost**: Higher cost due to complexity

### Bipedal Walking Fundamentals

#### Gait Patterns and Phases

**Walking Gait Cycle**:
The fundamental pattern of human-like walking, adapted for robotic systems.

**Basic Phases**:
- **Stance Phase**: Foot in contact with ground (about 60% of cycle)
- **Swing Phase**: Foot not in contact with ground (about 40% of cycle)

**Detailed Sub-phases**:
- **Initial Contact**: Heel strike at beginning of stance
- **Loading Response**: Weight transfer to stance leg
- **Mid Stance**: Body weight fully on stance leg
- **Terminal Stance**: Heel begins to rise
- **Pre-swing**: Toe-off and propulsion
- **Initial Swing**: Acceleration of swing leg
- **Mid Swing**: Limb passes under body
- **Terminal Swing**: Deceleration of swing leg

**Double Support Phase**:
When both feet are in contact with the ground during the transition between steps.

**Single Support Phase**:
When only one foot is in contact with the ground, requiring active balance control.

#### Balance and Stability in Bipedal Walking

**Center of Mass (CoM) Control**:
Critical for maintaining balance during bipedal walking.

**CoM Dynamics**:
- **Horizontal Movement**: CoM moves in an arc-like pattern
- **Vertical Movement**: CoM rises and falls during walking
- **Lateral Movement**: CoM moves side-to-side with each step
- **Stability Requirements**: CoM must remain within support polygon

**Support Polygon**:
The area defined by ground contact points that must contain the CoM for static stability.

**For Bipedal Robots**:
- **Single Support**: Support polygon is the area of one foot
- **Double Support**: Support polygon is the area between feet
- **Dynamic Balance**: CoM may extend beyond support polygon during dynamic walking

### Zero Moment Point (ZMP) Control

#### ZMP Concept

**Definition**:
The Zero Moment Point is a point on the ground where the net moment of the ground reaction forces is zero.

**Mathematical Expression**:
```
ZMP_x = x_CoM - (h/g) * ẍ_CoM
ZMP_y = y_CoM - (h/g) * ÿ_CoM
```
Where:
- (x_CoM, y_CoM) is the projection of the center of mass
- h is the height of the center of mass
- g is gravitational acceleration
- (ẍ_CoM, ÿ_CoM) are the accelerations of the center of mass

**Stability Condition**:
For stable walking, the ZMP must remain within the convex hull of the support polygon (typically the foot area).

#### ZMP-Based Walking Pattern Generation

**Preview Control Method**:
Using future ZMP references to generate stable walking patterns.

**Approach**:
- Define desired ZMP trajectory for walking
- Compute CoM trajectory using preview control
- Generate joint trajectories to follow CoM path
- Ensure ZMP remains within support polygon

**Mathematical Framework**:
The CoM trajectory follows the differential equation:
```
ẍ_CoM = ω² * (x_CoM - x_ZMP)
```
where ω = √(g/h) for CoM height h.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Define ZMP reference trajectory
2. Solve differential equation for CoM trajectory
3. Generate footstep locations and timing
4. Calculate joint trajectories to achieve CoM motion

### Capture Point Control

#### Capture Point Concept

**Definition**:
The capture point indicates where a robot must step to come to a complete stop.

**Mathematical Expression**:
```
Capture_Point = CoM_Position + √(h/g) * CoM_Velocity
```

**Advantages**:
- Simpler to compute than ZMP
- Intuitive concept for step planning
- Useful for push recovery
- Applicable to various locomotion patterns

#### Applications in Bipedal Walking

**Step Planning**:
Using capture point concepts for foot placement during walking.

**Approach**:
- Calculate current capture point

**Push Recovery**:
Using capture point for balance recovery after disturbances.

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Calculate new capture point after push
