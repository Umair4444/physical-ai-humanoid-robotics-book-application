## Lesson: Flying and Aerial Robotics

### Introduction to Aerial Robotics

Aerial robotics represents one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving areas of mobile robotics. Flying robots offer unique advantages including three-dimensional mobility, obstacle avoidance capability, and access to otherwise unreachable areas. This chapter explores the principles, technologies, and applications of aerial robotic systems, from fixed-wing aircraft to multirotor drones.

### Classification of Aerial Vehicles

#### Fixed-Wing Aircraft

**Principles of Operation**:
Fixed-wing aircraft generate lift through forward motion and wing design.

**Key Components**:
