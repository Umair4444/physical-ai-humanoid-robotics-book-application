## Lesson: Wheeled and Tracked Mobility Systems

### Introduction to Wheeled and Tracked Locomotion

Wheeled and tracked locomotion systems represent two of the most common and practical approaches to robotic mobility. Wheeled systems offer simplicity, efficiency, and speed on relatively flat surfaces, while tracked systems provide superior traction and stability on challenging terrain. Both approaches have distinct advantages and challenges that make them suitable for different applications in robotics.

### Wheeled Locomotion Systems

#### Types of Wheeled Configurations

**Fixed Wheels**:
Wheels that are fixed in orientation relative to the robot chassis.

**Configuration Types**:
- **Differential Drive**: Two independently controlled wheels on either side
- **Ackermann Steering**: Four wheels with front steering (like cars)
- **Tricycle**: One steerable front wheel, two fixed rear wheels
- **Omni-Directional**: Wheels with special treads for multi-directional movement

**Differential Drive Systems**:
Simple and common configuration using two independently controlled wheels.

**Advantages**:

**Mathematical Model**:
```
v_linear = (v_right + v_left) / 2
ω = (v_right - v_left) / W
```
Where W is the wheelbase (distance between wheels).

**Ackermann Steering Systems**:
Configuration similar to automobiles with steerable front wheels.

**Advantages**:

tan(δ_outer) = L / (R + W/2)
```
Where L is wheelbase, W is track width, δ are steering angles.

```
Where L_track is track length, W_track is track width.

**Advantages**:
