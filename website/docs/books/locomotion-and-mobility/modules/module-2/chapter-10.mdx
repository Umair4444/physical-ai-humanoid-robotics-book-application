## Lesson: Dynamic Walking and Gait Generation

### Introduction to Dynamic Walking

Dynamic walking is a form of locomotion that relies on the dynamic properties of the system to achieve efficient and stable movement. Unlike static walking, where the center of mass is always positioned within the support polygon, dynamic walking allows the center of mass to move outside the support base, relying on active control and dynamic effects to maintain stability. This approach can result in more human-like, energy-efficient, and faster walking patterns.

Dynamic walking principles include:
- **Dynamic balance**: Maintaining balance through controlled motion
- **Passive dynamics**: Utilizing natural dynamics for efficient movement
- **Active control**: Using control systems to maintain stability
- **Energy efficiency**: Minimizing energy consumption through dynamic effects
