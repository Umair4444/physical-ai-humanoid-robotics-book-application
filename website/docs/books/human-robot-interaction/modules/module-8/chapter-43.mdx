## Lesson: Professional Codes of Ethics for Human-Robot Interaction Practitioners

### Introduction to Professional Ethics in HRI

Professional codes of ethics for human-robot interaction (HRI) practitioners provide essential frameworks for ethical conduct in a field that intersects technology, social science, psychology, and ethics. Unlike general ethical principles that apply to all humans, professional codes of ethics address the specific responsibilities, challenges, and moral obligations that arise from specialized HRI knowledge and the trust placed in practitioners by society. These codes serve multiple functions: they guide individual practitioners in ethical decision-making, provide standards for professional accountability, inform public expectations about professional conduct, and establish the ethical foundation for the HRI profession.

The importance of professional ethics in HRI stems from the significant potential impact of HRI systems on human welfare, social structures, and human dignity. HRI practitioners possess specialized knowledge about the capabilities and limitations of social robotics systems that can significantly affect human lives, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities. The power of this specialized knowledge creates corresponding responsibilities to use it ethically and in service of human welfare rather than purely commercial or technical interests.

Professional ethics in HRI also address the complex challenges that arise from the intersection of artificial and human intelligence, the potential for manipulation or deception in human-robot relationships, and the long-term implications of human-robot interaction for society. As HRI practitioners work at the forefront of developing technologies that can influence human behavior, emotions, and relationships, they have special responsibilities to ensure that their work serves human flourishing and respects fundamental rights and values. The codes of ethics provide guidance for navigating these complex moral landscapes while maintaining professional integrity and public trust.

### Core Ethical Principles in HRI Professional Codes
