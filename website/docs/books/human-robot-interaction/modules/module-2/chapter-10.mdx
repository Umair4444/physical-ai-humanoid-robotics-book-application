## Lesson: Speech and Prosody in Robot Communication

### Introduction to Speech in HRI

Speech is one of the most natural and intuitive communication modalities for humans, making it a critical component of human-robot interaction (HRI). Effective speech communication in robots involves not only the ability to recognize and generate speech but also the capacity to use prosodic features to convey emotion, emphasis, and social meaning. Prosody, the melody and rhythm of speech, plays a crucial role in human communication by adding emotional and social nuance to verbal content.

Speech communication in HRI encompasses:
- **Speech recognition**: Understanding spoken input from users
- **Natural language processing**: Interpreting the meaning of speech
- **Speech synthesis**: Generating appropriate verbal responses
- **Prosodic expression**: Adding emotional and social nuance to speech
