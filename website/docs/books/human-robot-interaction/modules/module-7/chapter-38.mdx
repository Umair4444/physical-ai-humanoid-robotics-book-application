## Lesson: Professional Ethics and Standards for HRI Practitioners

### Introduction to Professional Ethics in HRI

Professional ethics in human-robot interaction (HRI) encompasses the moral principles, standards, and responsibilities that guide the conduct of researchers, designers, engineers, and other professionals working in the field of human-robot interaction. Unlike general ethical principles that apply to all humans, professional ethics in HRI involves specialized responsibilities that arise from the unique capabilities of social robotics technology and the trust placed in professionals by society to develop and deploy these powerful systems responsibly. The field of HRI ethics is particularly complex because it sits at the intersection of technology, social science, psychology, and ethics, requiring practitioners to consider not only technical excellence but also the broader social, psychological, and ethical implications of their work.

The professional responsibilities of HRI practitioners extend beyond the immediate technical performance of robotic systems to encompass their broader impact on human welfare, social structures, and human dignity. As HRI systems become more sophisticated and integrated into human social environments, the ethical implications of professional decisions become more significant and far-reaching. HRI practitioners must navigate complex ethical landscapes that include considerations of privacy, autonomy, justice, and human dignity while balancing these concerns with the technical and commercial requirements of their work.

Professional ethics in HRI also involves the responsibility to educate and inform the public, policymakers, and other stakeholders about the implications of HRI technology. This includes helping stakeholders understand both the potential benefits and risks of HRI systems, contributing to informed public discourse about HRI deployment, and ensuring that the development of HRI technology serves the public interest. The challenge for HRI professionals is to maintain technical excellence while upholding ethical principles and social responsibility, often in contexts where these goals may appear to conflict.

### Core Professional Ethical Principles
