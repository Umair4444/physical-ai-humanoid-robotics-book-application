## Lesson: Therapeutic and Care Applications of Emotional Robotics

### Introduction to Therapeutic and Care Robotics

Therapeutic and care applications of emotional robotics represent one of the most promising and ethically complex areas of human-robot interaction. These robots are specifically designed to provide emotional support, therapeutic interventions, and care assistance to individuals in need, particularly in healthcare, elderly care, and special needs support contexts. The emotional capabilities of these robots can provide significant benefits in therapeutic settings, but they also raise important ethical questions about the nature of care, the authenticity of emotional interactions, and the appropriate role of artificial entities in providing human support.

The therapeutic potential of emotional robotics stems from their ability to provide consistent, non-judgmental, and available emotional support. Unlike human caregivers who may experience fatigue, stress, or personal issues that affect their ability to provide care, therapeutic robots can offer continuous support without emotional burnout. However, the use of emotional robots in care contexts also raises concerns about the potential for emotional manipulation, the risk of replacing human relationships, and the ethical implications of creating emotional bonds with artificial entities.
