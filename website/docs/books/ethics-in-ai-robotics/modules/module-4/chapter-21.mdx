## Lesson: Risk Assessment and Management in AI-Powered Robotics

### Introduction to Risk in AI-Powered Robotics

Risk assessment and management in AI-powered robotics involves identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential hazards that arise from the combination of artificial intelligence and robotic systems. Unlike traditional robots that follow pre-programmed instructions, AI-powered robots can learn, adapt, and make autonomous decisions, introducing new types of risks that require specialized approaches to identification and management.

The integration of AI into robotic systems amplifies both the potential benefits and risks. While AI enables robots to operate more effectively in complex, dynamic environments, it also introduces uncertainties in behavior, decision-making, and safety. These uncertainties make risk assessment more challenging but also more critical for ensuring safe and ethical deployment of robotic systems.

### Types of Risks in AI-Powered Robotics

**Emergent Behaviors**: Complex interactions between AI algorithms and robotic systems may produce unintended behaviors that pose safety risks.

**Autonomy Failures**: Failures in AI decision-making systems that result in unsafe robot actions.

#### Security Risks
Risks related to unauthorized access or control:

**Adversarial Attacks**: Inputs designed to fool AI systems, causing the robot to make incorrect decisions or behave unsafely.
