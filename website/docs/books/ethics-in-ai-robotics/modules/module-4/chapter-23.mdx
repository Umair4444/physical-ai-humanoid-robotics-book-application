## Lesson: Crisis Management and Emergency Response in Robotic Systems

### Introduction to Crisis Management in Robotics

Crisis management and emergency response in robotic systems encompass the planning, preparation, and execution of procedures to handle unexpected events, failures, or dangerous situations involving robots. As robots become more prevalent in human environments, the potential for emergencies increases, making robust crisis management protocols essential for protecting human safety, property, and operational continuity.

Robotic systems operate in complex environments where unexpected events can occur, from hardware failures and software glitches to external threats and environmental hazards. Unlike traditional systems, robots often operate autonomously and in close proximity to humans, making emergency response more complex. Effective crisis management must account for the unique characteristics of robotic systems, including their autonomy, mobility, and interaction with the physical world.

### Types of Robotic Emergencies
